# ‚òÅÔ∏è CloudLaunch AWS Deployment

## Overview
**CloudLaunch** is a lightweight AWS-based environment that demonstrates fundamental AWS services ‚Äî **S3**, **IAM**, and **VPC** ‚Äî for hosting a basic company website and securely managing internal resources.

This deployment includes:
- A public static website hosted on **Amazon S3**
- A private bucket for restricted internal file storage
- A secure **VPC** with properly segmented subnets and route configurations
- Strict IAM-based access control following the principle of least privilege

## ü™£ Task 1 ‚Äì Static Website Hosting with S3 + IAM

### üîπ S3 Buckets

| Bucket Name | Description | Access Level |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|

| **cloudlaunch-private-bucket** | Stores private internal files | Private (IAM-controlled) |
| **cloudlaunch-visible-only-bucket** | Appears in S3 bucket list but objects are not accessible | Visible only (no object access) |

### ‚úÖ Static Website Setup
